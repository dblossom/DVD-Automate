DVD-Automate
============

Scripts to automate coping DVD's with HandBrakeCLI

burn_DVD: a script that loops a dir and for every sub-dir it will find the video files and decode them.

copy_DVD / copy_BR: copy files from optical drive to location. Files are the same minus different drive paths to allow two at once. Need to allow paramater passing so we can delete one of these.
